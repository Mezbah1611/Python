Task Name : Exploratory Data
Analysis using Python



Task Overview:
In this group work project, you will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a given dataset
using Python. You will apply various statistical techniques and hypothesis testing methods to
analyze the dataset and draw meaningful insights. Each person in the group is responsible for
one task.


Tasks:
1. Outlier Detection using IQR method or Z-Score method
   ○ Detect outliers using either the Interquartile Range (IQR) method or the Z-Score
       method.
    ○ Visualize the distribution of data and identify outliers through plots (e.g., box
       plots, scatter plots).
2. Correlation Finding for at least 2 Columns and Apply Regression
    ○ Compute the correlation between at least two columns using pandas correlation
       functions.
    ○ Visualize the correlations using a heatmap and apply a simple regression model
       to analyze relationships.
3. Check for Normal, Binomial, or Poisson Distribution
    ○ Check whether the attributes follow a Normal, Binomial, or Poisson distribution.
    ○ Use statistical tests such as the Shapiro-Wilk test or visualizations like
       histograms and Q-Q plots.
4. Apply Naive Bayes on at least 3 Columns and Find the Output Column
    ○ Implement Naive Bayes on at least three selected columns in the dataset.
    ○ Use the prior probabilities and likelihood functions to calculate posterior
       probabilities, interpreting the output column.
5. Hypothesis Testing on Selected Variables
    ○ Conduct hypothesis testing on variables of interest.
    ○ Use appropriate tests such as the one-sample t-test, two-sample t-test, or
       chi-square test, and interpret the results.
